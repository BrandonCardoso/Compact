{"name":"Steam Compact","tagline":"A skin for the Steam client, by seq","body":"### General Information\r\nThis is the only place where I make my skin available. Any mirrors or copies found elsewhere are not endorsed by me.\r\n\r\nI will always post what Steam version my skin is compatible with, so please check that before reporting any issues.\r\n\r\n### Installation instructions and advice\r\nThe directory structure in the .zip file lets you quite quickly figure out where to extract the contents. After you've extracted the contents of the archive you go to **Settings › Interface** and select the **Compact** skin.\r\n\r\nI _strongly_ advise you to disable DirectWrite font smoothing in **Settings › Interface** when using\r\nthis skin, since these small font sizes aren't even remotely suitable for DirectWrite.\r\n\r\n**Linux** users: Read the included readme for instructions how to install this skin on Linux. \r\nA few issues with fonts requires some manual work. Please let me know if you experience any issues with this, I haven't tested it much myself\r\n\r\n### Information about current version  (updated August 29, 2015)\r\nVersion 1.5.58 is compatible with Steam version **1440016726, August 19 2015**\r\n\r\nChanges since previous version include:\r\n* Updated to match Steam version 1440016726 (built 150819)\r\n* Adjustments to the Downloads window\r\n* Adjustments to the Details window\r\n* Fixed a few inconsistencies for Polish language users\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving any issues? Either report it the issue tracker here or in the [Steam Community Group](http://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamCompact).\r\n\r\n### Beta development\r\nI will sometimes have a specific branch available for beta versions compatible with ongoing Steam beta development, I'm looking into it. I'll update with further details here when I have something to share. \r\n\r\nIf you like living on the edge I might sometimes also have a dev branch going for any Steam beta development. This is only when I have the time and inclination for it though. You also need to expect things being broken and messed up since this will be my test bed that I use while working on _regular_ updates, so I'm not kidding when I call it \"living on the edge\". Please don't issue any bug reports based on these builds.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (updated January 27, 2015)\r\n![Main view](http://i.imgur.com/2A4My8G.png)\r\n![Details view](http://i.imgur.com/HRbAA19.png)\r\n![Overlay](http://i.imgur.com/vqrnNmr.png)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
