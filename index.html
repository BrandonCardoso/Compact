<p>This is the only place where I make my skin available. Any mirrors or copies found elsewhere are not endorsed by me.</p>

<p>I will always post what Steam version my skin is compatible with, so please check that before reporting any issues.</p>

<p>The directory structure in the .zip file lets you quite quickly figure out where to extract the contents. After you've extracted the contents of the archive you go to <strong>Settings › Interface</strong> and select the <strong>Compact</strong> skin.</p>

<p>I <em>strongly</em> advise you to disable DirectWrite font smoothing in <strong>Settings › Interface</strong> when using
this skin, since these small font sizes aren't even remotely suitable for DirectWrite.</p>

<p><strong>Linux</strong> users: Read the included readme for instructions how to install this skin on Linux. 
A few issues with fonts requires some manual work. Please let me know if you experience any issues with this, I haven't tested it much myself</p>

<p>Keep in mind that I will only have beta versions compatible with the Steam beta when I have the time and inclination for it. Always check the compatibility note for each release I have available. </p>

<p><strong>"Stable" beta</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>I will sometimes have a specific branch available for beta versions compatible with ongoing Steam beta development that are considered stable enough for everyday use, I'm looking into how to set that up. I'll update with further details here when I have something to share.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Beta versions in development</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you like living on the edge I might sometimes also have a dev branch going for any Steam beta development called <strong>Steam-beta-dev</strong>. If you use this you need to expect things being broken and messed up since this will be dev build  that I use while working on future updates, so I'm not kidding when I call it "living on the edge". Please don't issue any bug reports based on these builds.</p>
